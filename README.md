# Calculator Symbolic Computation

A recursive calculator that simulates arithmetic operations using only **addition (+) and subtraction (-)**. The project explores numerical computation concepts, recursion, and algorithmic efficiency.

## ðŸ”¹ Overview

This implementation ensures that all operationsâ€”multiplication, division, exponentiation, factorial, and Fibonacciâ€”are derived exclusively from addition and subtraction, reinforcing numerical computation principles.

## ðŸ”¹ Methodology

- **Multiplication**: Defined as repeated addition.  
- **Division**: Implemented via iterative subtraction, returning quotient and remainder.  
- **Exponentiation**: Expressed as recursive multiplication.  
- **Factorial**: Computed recursively using defined multiplication.  
- **Fibonacci**: Optimized with memoization to improve performance.

## ðŸ”¹ Usage

Clone the repository and execute:

```sh
python calculadora.py
```

The graphical interface (Tkinter) allows users to input values and perform operations dynamically.
